<title>Hydrogen supply</title>
<para>
Where delivery method permits, your H2MDK will be supplied with pre-filled HydroSTIK. 
To refill your HydroSTIK we recommend that you purchase a Horizon Fuel Cell HydroFILL home electrolyser which generates hydrogen from electricity and distilled water. HydroFILL can run on mains electricity or on DC.
