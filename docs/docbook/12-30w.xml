<title>System Overview</title>

<para>The H2MDK30 kit enables the user to easily design and build fuel cell systems using a Horizon H-12 or H-30 PEM fuel cell stacks to deliver 12W or 30W respectively.</para>

<para>An open source platform supported by an online developer forum encourages rapid customisation of systems, control and user interface for a wide range of applications from model trains, planes and automobiles, to remote monitoring systems. 
</para>

<para>This manual doesn't attempt to replace the manual that comes with the fuel cell stack. Read the fuel cell manual to get an understanding of how to properly treat the stack.</para>

<para>
Photographs in this guide show the H-12 stack, but instructions apply equally the H-30 stack.

If you plan to use more than 20W with the H-30, you may need to connect 2 hydroSTIKs with a tee splitter to the H-30 to increase the flow of hydrogen.</important>

<important>
The fuel cell stack requires unobstructed airflow to all vents in order to function as the oxygen used in the electrochemical reaction is drawn through these vents. Obstructed air supply will reduce the performance and lifetime of your stacks.</important>

<listitem>Ensure stack is mounted or positioned so that the vents on both sides are open to the air</listitem>
<listitem>Open the clip on the tube to allow hydrogen to flow into the fuel cell stack. It is normal for the HydroSTIK to get cold during operation - how cold will depend on factors including current drawn and ambient temperature. The fans on the fuel cell should start spinning</listitem>

Care should be taken not to overload the stack. Ensure that the maximum current drawn by your equipment cannot exceed that which the stack can supply (12 or 30W).

<sect1 id="Power output and conditioning">
<title>Power output &amp; conditioning</title>

<para>The 12/30W H2MDK Fuel Cell Shield controls the fuel cell, but does not regulate the output power (unlike the 3W Shield which has inbuilt voltage regulation and smoothing). Thus the voltage you see across the load terminals of the Shield is that of the fuel cell stack. Furthermore, by default the Shield short-circuits the stack periodically to maintain stack condition and in this time the power output will drop to zero (an onboard capacitor maintains power to the Arduino during shorting).</para>

<para>One of the first projects you will likely undertake is to add power conditioning. Depending on the requirements of your load (e.g. 12V, 24V), you should be able to find an off-the-shelf DC-DC convertor to suit your needs. For advanced users, you can of course build your own, making use of the Pulse Width Modulation output from the Arduino.</para>

<para>The plots below show the characteristics of the H-12, H-20 and H-30 as supplied off-the-shelf by Horizon. Note that the H-20 is the same physical stack as the H-12, but it can deliver more power because the H-12 is supplied without any fuel cell control (short-circuiting and purging). Knowing this you can decide whether to simplify your system and run without short-circuiting at lower power or increase complexity by adding capacitors to smooth the output during short-circuit and therefore achieve higher power.</para>

<para>Find out more about frequency and duration of short-circuiting by studying the <ulink url="http://www.github.com/arcolaenergy.com/">library.</ulink></para>
